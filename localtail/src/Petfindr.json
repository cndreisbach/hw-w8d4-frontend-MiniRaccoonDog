      "description": "Meet Sage!\nApprox. 3-4 y/o Female \nHi everyone. My name is Sage and look at me, Iâ\u0080\u0099m gorgeous! I am a bit of a snuggler. I like to go out with my foster pals and romp for a little while but my favorite spot is beside you. I am completely crate and house trained. I've done awesome with my current foster siblings, but it hasn't always been so great. To be with other dogs I require very slow intros and experience. I'd love to have a family that would give me all of their love and affection. If youâ\u0080\u0099re looking for a lifelong companion who is stunningly beautiful and guaranteed to turn heads you have found her right here. I Look forward to meeting you.",
